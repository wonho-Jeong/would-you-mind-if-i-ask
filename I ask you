int add(int one, int two) {
int sum = one + two;
return sum;
}
1. Make a function called add() that accepts two integers as parameters and returns the sum.
2. Make a function called subtract() that accepts two numbers and subtracts one from the other and returns the difference.
3. Make a function called multiply() that accepts two numbers and multiplies them together, then returns the product.
4. In your main() function, create a loop that will repeat forever. At the start of the loop, a menu is displayed to ask the user which options they would like to do.
5. If the user enters 0, exit the loop, immediately.
6. If the user enters 1, 2, or 3, the loop is not exited and the user is asked for 2 values.
7. Depending on the menu input, either add the numbers, subtract them, or multiply them using the add(), subtract(), and multiply() functions.
8. When the program is about to exit, print out "Bye-bye!".
9. Have a nicely-formatted multi-line comment at the top of your code with this information:
